              <p class="tileText">I (left) grew up in Berlin, Germany. I moved to Toronto for a year by myself from 16 to 17, where I was first introduced to programming and discovered my love for it. After moving back to Berlin for a few years, I started my studies at the University of Sheffield. By recently taking part in Sheffield's and Oxford's Hackathons, I've found myself a huge passion for these types of coding events. Apart from that, I like American football and my friends.</p>
